<p> <b> Hi, I am Kp &#128075 </b> </p>

<p>:capital_abcd: Data speaks the truth, intuitions can be wrong.
<br>&#128202 I realized the importance of data analytics while working with my one of my previous employer, wherein I had used data and visualization to deliver exceptional results.
<br>&#127891 I then pursued and completed a Master of Business Analytics (MBAN'21) degree from Schulich School of Business, York University, Toronto.
<br>&#128119 I did an analytics consuling project with Deloitte Omnia AI on SAS Viya migration and deployment, and then continued to work at Deloitte post my graduation as a Data Engineer.
<br>&#9729 I am building my cloud technology skills, and currently hold the aws certified Cloud Practitioner, and Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Fundamentals titles
